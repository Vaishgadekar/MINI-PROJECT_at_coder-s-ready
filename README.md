# MINI-PROJECT_at_coder-s-ready
EDA is applied to investigate the data and summarize the key insights. It will give you the basic understanding of your data, it's distribution, null values and much more. You can either explore data using graphs or through some python functions

# GENRATING DATA WITH NOISE AND MULITIPLE FILE HANDLING
Noisy data are data that is corrupted, distorted, or has a low Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Improper procedures (or improperly-documented procedures) to subtract out the noise in data can lead to a false sense of accuracy or false conclusions. Data = true signal + noise.

### gaussian curve fitting
The gauss method is used to get a floating value chosen from a Gaussian or normal distribution with the given mean and standard deviation. What is normal or Gaussian distribution? When we plot a dataset such as a histogram, the shape of that charted plot is what we call its distribution. The most commonly observed shape of continuous values is the bell curve, also called the Gaussian or normal distribution.

### single file handling
lognorm function
A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the product of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the sum of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables.

# HOTEL-BOOKINGS-DATA-EXPOLORATION
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

We will perform exploratory data analysis with python to get insight from the data.

### This article on medium explains the entire the process Exploratory Data Analysis of the Hotel Booking Demand with Python

###Table of Content Motivation Tools and Libraries Used Files Result Dataset Information Acknowledgements Motivation We have tried to answer the following Questions - - How Many Booking Were Cancelled?
- What is the booking ratio between Resort Hotel and City Hotel? 
- What is the percentage of booking for each year?
- Which is the most busy month for hotel? 
- How Long People Stay in the hotel?



### Tools and Libraries Used
We have used Python 3 to its following packages:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn Sklearn

Hotel Booking.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file contains all the python code, documentation and visualization

Dataset contains following features:

hotel is_canceled lead_time arrival_date_year arrival_date_month arrival_date_week_number arrival_date_day_of_month stays_in_weekend_nights stays_in_week_nights adults children babies meal country market_segment distribution_channel is_repeated_guest previous_cancellations previous_bookings_not_canceled reserved_room_type assigned_room_type booking_changes deposit_type agent company days_in_waiting_list customer_type adr required_car_parking_spaces total_of_special_requests reservation_status reservation_status_date

Result
We learned that August month is maximum hotel booking month july ,may,octomber,april comes in decending order after the august
