# MINI-PROJECT_at_coder-s-ready
EDA is applied to investigate the data and summarize the key insights. It will give you the basic understanding of your data, it's distribution, null values and much more. You can either explore data using graphs or through some python functions

# GENRATING DATA WITH NOISE AND MULITIPLE FILE HANDLING
Noisy data are data that is corrupted, distorted, or has a low Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Improper procedures (or improperly-documented procedures) to subtract out the noise in data can lead to a false sense of accuracy or false conclusions. Data = true signal + noise.

gaussian curve fitting
The gauss method is used to get a floating value chosen from a Gaussian or normal distribution with the given mean and standard deviation. What is normal or Gaussian distribution? When we plot a dataset such as a histogram, the shape of that charted plot is what we call its distribution. The most commonly observed shape of continuous values is the bell curve, also called the Gaussian or normal distribution.

single file handling
lognorm function
A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the product of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the sum of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables.
